# Blazor Lightbox

This project was created to create a HTML Lightbox control to be used in a Blazor application

## Why

After doing some online searching, I could not find a Blazor Lightbox control, so I decided to create one.  

At first glance it seems straight forward, and it was for the most part.  The Blazor part was adding and removing style class which we have done several times before.

We made it more interesting by adding video support and making it a component.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorLightbox
   cd BlazorLightbox
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template but the code is the same wither it is Server side or client side.

1. Adding and removing style class on click events
2. Creating and calling a component
3. Adding parameters to the component
4.Adding support for streaming video as the larger content
